## Overview

This system allows you to define phonological transformations using a simple selector syntax. Selectors can target phonemes based on their features (like [vowel], [consonant], [voiced], etc.) and their position in words.


## Test Coverage

This codebase is tested with each release to ensure that the features are working properly.  If you'd like to verify that the current build is functioning properly, you can refer to [this page!](./test-report.html)
